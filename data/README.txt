This file is a placeholder for the data/ folder on GitHub.  Please download the "ledger_len.csv" data from Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/records/14834841) and upload to this directory.

Then download the input data (i.e., DataCVFolds.zip and Data_SurveyPlusDemographics.txt) from the FairPsych NLP repository(https://github.com/nd-hal/fair-psych-nlp/tree/main/Data) and place Data_SurveyPlusDemographics.txt into the DataCVFolds/ directory.


The final directory structure should be:

data/
  |_
     ledger_len.csv
     DataCVFolds/
                |_
                   ContinuousCV/
                   Data_SurveyPlusDemographics.txt
                   MedianCV/
